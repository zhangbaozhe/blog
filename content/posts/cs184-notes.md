This is a post about my notes on learning the 
computer graphics course at CUHK-Shenzhen (where many of 
the materials are quite similar to those in CS184). 
The homepage for CS184 is at [here](https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/sp24).
My assignment achievements:
- Assignment 1 Rasterizer: [page](https://zhangbaozhe.github.io/cal-cs184-p1-rasterizer-sp24/)
